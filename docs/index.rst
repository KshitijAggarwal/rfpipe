rfpipe: radio interferometric transient search library
=======================================================

rfpipe is a library for radio interferometric transient searches. It takes visibility data as input and searches for impulsive, astrophysical sources. Currently, rfpipe is optimized for `VLA <https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/vla/>`_ data and image-based searches, but the design supports other telescopes, algorithms, and computing environments.

rfpipe is the core transient search library of the realfast project. For more information, see `our ApJS paper <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018arXiv180203084L/abstract>`_ or visit http://realfast.io. This software can be cited via the ASCL: |ascl|.
