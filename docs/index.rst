rfpipe: radio interferometric transient search
=================================================

Overview
---------

rfpipe is a library for radio interferometric transient searches. It takes interferometric visibilities as input and can search them for transients. Currently, rfpipe is optimized for `VLA <https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/vla/>`_ data and image-based searches, but the design is intended to allow other telescopes and algorithms.

rfpipe is the core transient search library of the realfast project. For more information, see `our ApJS paper <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018arXiv180203084L/abstract>`_ or visit http://realfast.io. This software can be cited via this link: |ascl|.
